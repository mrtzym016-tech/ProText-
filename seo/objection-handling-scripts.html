<h1>Objection Handling Scripts That Close More Deals</h1>

<p>Objections are not rejection. They are signals that the client needs clarity, reassurance, or more information.</p>

<h2>Price Objection</h2>
<p>"I completely understand that budget is important. Many of our clients initially felt the same, but once they saw the long-term value, they realized the investment actually saved them money."</p>

<h2>“I Need to Think About It”</h2>
<p>"That makes sense. Just so I can support you properly, what specific part would you like more clarity on?"</p>

<h2>Trust Objection</h2>
<p>"That’s a fair concern. Let me show you real examples and testimonials so you can see the results firsthand."</p>
